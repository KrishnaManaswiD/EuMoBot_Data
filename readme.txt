The data in this folder supports the paper titled
EuMoBot: Replicating Euglenoid Movement in a Soft Robot

Authors: Krishna Manaswi Digumarti, Andrew Conn and Jonathan Rossiter

This folder contains six files of csv type. They are as follows:

1. centroids_largeRobot - coordinates of centroids of the large robot recorded during multiple trials along with timestamp.
			  formatted as x1,y1,t1,x2,y2,t2,... for each data point.
2. centroids_smallRobot - coordinates of centroids of the small robot recorded during multiple trials along with timestamp.
			  formatted as x1,y1,t1,x2,y2,t2,... for each data point.
3. estimatedChamberArea - each row of this file is a triplet containing area of red, green and blue chamber of the small robot. Each row is one frame of recording.
4. fourierCoefficients_euglenoid - set of normalised Fourier coefficients computed from the shapes of the euglenoid. Each row corresponds to one shape.
5. fourierCoefficients_largeRobot - set of normalised Fourier coefficients computed from the shapes of the large robot. Each row corresponds to one shape.
6. fourierCoefficients_smallRobot - set of normalised Fourier coefficients computed from the shapes of the small robot. Each row corresponds to one shape.
